# github-notifier
GitHub-Notifier is a simple personal GitHub timeline notifier, which upon clicking takes you to GitHub page behind the notifcation.

## Usage
```
./github-notifier -u '<username>' -p '<password>'
```

You can run it in a background. It polls every 30 seconds and makes sure the notification are not too old and does not allow repeats.

__password note__: you may also use Personal Access tokens for the password. To do this, in account settings in Github, create a new access token and use this token for your password.
